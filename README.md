# arduinoLG
A Liquid Galaxy controller built with Arduino
## Prerequisites
- KML API should be installed
## Working
![Arduino LG Controller](https://github.com/omairqazi29/arduinoLG/Arduino%20LG%20Controller.mp4)

BUTTONS: Since I don't have 8x8 push buttons, I used jumper wires acting like a push button.
The Python code listens to Arduino messages and then makes a GET request to the KML API.
